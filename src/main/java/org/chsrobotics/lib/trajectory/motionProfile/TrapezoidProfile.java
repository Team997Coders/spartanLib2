/**
 * Represents a special case of an {@link AsymmetricTrapezoidProfile} where the maxAcceleration and
 * maxDeceleration constraints are the same.
 *
 * <p>A motion profile that allows for smooth motion between two states. The dx/dt of this motion
 * (velocity) forms the trapezoid shape on a graph. The particular elements of motion are velocity
 * and acceleration limited.
 *
 * <p>The most useful practical application of this is use defining the setpoint for a PID (or
 * similar) controller, to avoid control effort saturation or the initial spike in input from the P
 * term.
 *
 * <p>Also could be used to meet physical constraints from a mechanism (can't go too fast or the
 * wires might tangle, mechanism has too much mass to decelerate too quickly, etc...).
