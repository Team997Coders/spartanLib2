/**
 * A MotionProfile that allows for smooth motion between two states, generated with acceleration,
 * velocity, and deceleration constraints.
 *
 * <p>The dx/dt of this motion (velocity) forms the trapezoid shape on a graph. The particular
 * elements of motion are velocity and acceleration limited, with acceleration limiting having
 * different constraints for the initial phase of motion ("maxAcceleration"), and the final phase of
 * motion ("maxDeceleration").
 *
 * <p>The most useful practical application of this is use defining the setpoint for a PID (or
 * similar) controller, to avoid control effort saturation or the initial spike in input from the P
 * term.
 *
 * <p>Also could be used to meet physical constraints from a mechanism (can't go too fast or the
 * wires might tangle, has to decelerate at a different rate depending on the location in its track,
 * etc...).
